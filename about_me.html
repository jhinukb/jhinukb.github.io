    <!-- A section that describes me -->
  <p><br>Hey there! First, I would like to thank you for visiting my website!
     So..you're probably wondering, who am I? I am Jhinuk, a senior majoring in Data Science with a concentration
     in Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. I am graduating in December 2019. 
    My journey into Data Science began when I took Data8,
     the introductory Data Science course. Ever since then, I have been inspired by the intersection
     of technology and education. I also dabble in graphic design through various positions. <br />

     <b>How am I involved with my university?</b> I am currently working in the Curriculum Development and Peer Advising Team for the Divison of Data Sciences. 
      I was also part of the analytics committee for the Data Science Society where I collaborated on data science research projects.
     I am part of the Society of Women Engineers and AFX Dance Outreach Committee
     where I work on Graphic Design. <br />

     <b>My life is not solely composed of academics</b>: In my free time (when I have any), I enjoy urban dancing on the AFX Dance Team, baking (I took a baking DeCal!), hiking and playing the piano.
     I am seeking internships in Data Science, Software Engineering, Computational Biology or Graphic Design.<br /> <br />

      If you are interested, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jhinuk.barman@berkeley.edu">jhinuk.barman@berkeley.edu</a> <br /> <br />
      Have a wonderful day!
      ~Jhinuk Barman
